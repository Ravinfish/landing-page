    <h1>My name is Ravin Fisher and welcome to my Portfolio</h1>

    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>I was born and raised in the PNW. I have two sisters and two brothers. I started working for U.S. Bank at the age of 18 in their call center as an internet banking specilist. After three years of taking calls, I decided to move to a branch as a Universal Banker. In my first year, I was able to become a top performing banker for my region, earning awards several quarters/years in a row. I moved on to corporate trust banking from there, and became an Account Associate. I was able to assist in multiple projects and in June of 2019 I was promoted to an Account Manager. There I was able to build close relationships with my clients.</p>
    <h3>Why Coding?</h3>
    <p>I decided to take an Intro to coding class after talking to my sister had completed the same course. She had shared some of the perks of why she liked the class and they seemed to resignate with me. The main one that I really liked was the promblem solving aspect. So here I am, taking this class and gaining a new skill. Hopfully this will lead to a new career where I can also utilize some of my prior experience.</p>

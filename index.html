    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>I was born and raised in the PNW. I have two sisters and two brothers. I started working for U.S. Bank at the age of 18 in their call center as an internet banking specilist. After three years of taking calls, I decided to move to a branch as a Universal Banker. In my first year, I was able to become a top performing banker for my region, earning awards several quarters/years in a row. I moved on to corporate trust banking from there, and became an Account Associate. I was able to assist in multiple projects and in June of 2019 I was promoted to an Account Manager.</p>
